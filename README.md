# Goal
I wanted to see if there was a strong correlation, if any, between a player's batting average on the year, and wheter or not that player made the playoffs. 
# Processing 
The range of data I used were the top 10 batting averages from the each of the baseball seasons betweeen 2015-2020. 
I used data from ESPN and MLB baseball stat books to input players, batting average, the season year, and playoffs (1-did make playoffs,0-did not make playoffs).
I inputed this data into excel.

Using python, I was able to produce a correlation table using the batting average, year, and playoff births as my variables just to grasp the trends I was seeing in my graphs.

The Histogram represents the highest MLB averages from the last 5 years and the frequency that it occured.

![Scatter plot matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdulski8/Personal_Dataset_Project/master/Scatter%20Matrix%20.png)

I used the Scatter Plot matrix to see correlation amongst the different variables.

depicts correlation between one's batting average and whether or not they made the playoffs with their batting average.

![Linear Regression Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdulski8/Personal_Dataset_Project/master/Linear%20regression%20.png)

I used a Linear Regression Model to visualize the correlation between the player's batting average variable and playoff birth variable. 

# Findings

After simple analysis of the data, there is a very low, if not any correlation between whether a player's batting average results in their team's birth into the playoffs. This is an interesting idea in that MLB front offices should potentially look into different ways of spending when trying to build a playoff team.

I used the stat books from both Major League Baseball and ESPN to recieve batting average, year, player, and playoff data. 

I restricted the data from the seasons of 2015-2020.
