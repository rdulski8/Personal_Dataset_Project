# Goal
I wanted to see if there was a strong correlation, if any, between a player's batting average on the year, and wheter or not that player made the playoffs.
# Processing 
I used data from ESPN and MLB baseball stat books to input players, batting average, the season year, and playoffs (1-did make playoffs,0-did not make playoffs).
I inputed this data into excel.

The Histogram represents the highest MLB averages from the last 5 years and the frequency that it occured. 

The Scatter Plot matrix depicts correlation between one's batting average and whether or not they made the playoffs with their batting average.
