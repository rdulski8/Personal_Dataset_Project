# Goal
I wanted to see if there was a strong correlation, if any, between a player's batting average on the year, and wheter or not that player made the playoffs.
# Processing 
The range of data I used were the top 10 batting averages from the each of the baseball seasons betweeen 2015-2020. 
I used data from ESPN and MLB baseball stat books to input players, batting average, the season year, and playoffs (1-did make playoffs,0-did not make playoffs).
I inputed this data into excel.

Using python, I was able to produce a correlation table using the batting average, year, and playoff births as my variables just to grasp the trends I was seeing in my graphs.

I used the Scatter Plot matrix to see correlation amongst the different variables. depicts correlation between one's batting average and whether or not they made the playoffs with their batting average.
